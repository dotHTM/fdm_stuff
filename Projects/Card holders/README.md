## Card Holders

Import SVG into your slicer of choice, confirm scale by setting the Y height of the object (70.4 mm as of this writing) with a matching X scale, and adjust the Z "extrusion" to be as long as you'd like and/or can print on your machine.

Standard US playing cards are just under 64 mm, so three wide plus a little wiggle for comfort should be able to fan several per row.

I like the version "with token bin" to be printed one card wide, so that several can be printed in a multi-color filiment to get my four player shades in one print job. Good for an auction system like the court in Arcs.
